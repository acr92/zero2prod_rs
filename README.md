This project is based on the book [Zero to Production in Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com) by Luca Palmieri. The goal is to learn Rust by building a production-ready web application from scratch, following the guidance provided by the author.

In this repository, you will find my implementation of the concepts presented in the book, along with some personal improvements, such as using testcontainers for testing.

This project aims to implement the concepts presented in the book while also exploring additional improvements to enhance the overall learning experience.
